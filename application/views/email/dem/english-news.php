Dear <strong>{name}</strong>,<br />
	the holidays are over and we want to begin the autumn with some little news!</strong><br /><br />
	Our weeks will always be <strong>open</strong>, which means that all the received photos will be instantly visible on the website!<br />
	Plus, your photos will be automatically approved so they will be published on the wall as soon as we'll receive them!
	<br />
	<strong>Remember, the main rule is always the same: one photo each theme! :)</strong><br /><br/>
	
	From now on, you can also share your photos on your favorite social networks: <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Twitter</strong> and you can also share a photo via <strong>Tumblr</strong> auto-post feature!<br /><br />
	
	As always, each <strong>Wednesday</strong> a <strong>winner</strong> will be announced and its <strong>photo</strong> will remain published on our home page for all the day!<br />
	Come back and visit us with your wonderful ideas!
	
	<br /><br /><br />With love,<br />
	<strong>We Love Difference team</strong>
