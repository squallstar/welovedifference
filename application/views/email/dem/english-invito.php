  	<a style="color:#61b89f" href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>"><strong>We Love Difference</strong></a>, let's see the world from the eyes of other people.<br /><br />
  	It's a website where <strong>people</strong> can <strong>share</strong> their personal <strong>points of view</strong> with <strong>photos</strong>, illustrations (etc..) about many themes related to objects, experiences, feelings and many other things that users will propose weekly, <strong>one per week</strong>!
<br /><br />
So read carefully the <strong>theme of the week</strong> and think about a photo that will represent it. You got the <strong>whole week</strong> to decide your photo to upload, and after the deadline (<strong>Sunday night</strong>) we will <strong>publish</strong> all received works about that theme, and we'll announce the theme of the <strong>next week</strong>.
<br /><br />
If you are interested, feel free to <a style="color:#61b89f" href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>">visit us</a> so we can prove this words with facts, or simply let's come to see other people's works about the <a style="color:#61b89f" href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>">current week</a>!
