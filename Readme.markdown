WE LOVE DIFFERENCE
==================

We Love Difference is an open-source project to let the people upload their photos about a theme, one each week.

The project had been developed in PHP5 with CodeIgniter framework and is released live on http://welovedifference.com/

We decided to suspend the project due to lack of users during august 2011.
